# QikserveMockTest

This is the development of the QikServe Engineer Technical Test.

The following instructions should be followed in a Linux machine.

In order to make it run, you have to:

1. Download the "AmazingStore.tar" file and copy it to the desired folder.
2. Unzip the file with "tar -xvf AmazingStore.tar" 
3. Run the shell script "./initAmazingStore.sh"

IMPORTANT: The script (in step 3), will initialize both the Spring Application (which contains my code for the Challange)
and the Wiremock server, provided by Qikservem in order to mock the data for the Challange.
