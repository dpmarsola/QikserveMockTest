Follow-up Questions

How long did you spend on the test?
About 15 hours.

What would you add if you had more time?
I would put a lot of thoughts into the web design. Make it nice looking and functional.

How would you improve the product APIs that you had to consume?
They responded with poor (or faulty) JSON mapping. I had to explicitly rectify the JSON received in order to correctly extract its data.
The promotions were also hard to calculate because of the way they were responded by the API. 

What did you find most difficult?
I had a really hard time trying to make the front-end work. The back-end was really easy to make, but the logic I used in this project gave a lot of work on the
Javascript side. I ended up using JavaScript for all the calculations and message formatting, leaving the backend only for communicating with the Wiremock APIs.

How did you find the overall experience, any feedback for us?
I liked the experience. I know that, given the right amount of time, I could make this project look a lot better.
